## Project objective

This project is served as project homework 1 of Northeastern University's Spring 2021's CS-5610 class. You could find the class link in below class link section.

As the first project in the class, the goal is to create a simple, more than 2-page website using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. I believe this is a great chance for me to demonstrate what I have learned in the class so far.

I have designed a simple website with two pages. The first page is a resume style home page using a free template. The second page is a gallery designed by others, but I use JavaScript code to generate the HTML elements instead. I have shared 5 of my favorite restaurants and some photos from one of my Lake Tahoe ski trips.
